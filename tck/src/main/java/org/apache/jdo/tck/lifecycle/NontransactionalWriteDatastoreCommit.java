 *
 * <p>A5.6.2-8 [If an optimistic transaction is begun, commit will write the changes to the
 * datastore after checking as to the current state of the instances in the datastore. The changes
 * made outside the transaction together with any changes made inside the transaction will update
 * the current state of the datastore if the version checking is successful.]
 *
 * <p>A5.6.2-10 [If an optimistic transaction is begun, rollback will not write any changes to the
 * datastore. The persistent-nontransactional-dirty instances will transition according to the
 * RestoreValues flag. ]
